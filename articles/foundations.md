# Foundations

- Foundations

*The Basics are your most important asset.
That is why you should invest a lot of your time into the foundations.
Especially if you are just starting out or are embarking onto new terrain.
This is why we will cover the foundations regularly from different angles.*

No matter what topi you look up on your search engine of choice it is almost guaranteed that within the first page of results there will be some blog article or video stating to help you in "ten easy steps" or give you "great results in five minutes".
Of course this sounds good and more often than not we are very likely to click on such a link to see what that quick solution is all about.
Depending on the topic or the situation you are in those quick fixes may have their merit.
Maybe those quick fixes can even set you on a path to dive deeper.
But more often than not those quick fixes stay in the shallow water, afraid or unable to go deeper.
What this ultimately leads to is a ever further stretching shallowness of content that rarely brings new information to the light and instead regurgitates content found elsewhere.
I am painting broad strokes here and some of those quick fixes actually display valuable information of a high quality. 
But to discern that you have to have at least a basic amount of knowledge on the topic yourself.
This is an important an critical distinction.
Because wether you are starting out for the first time or venturing into unknown territory you do not have yet the tools to tell quality content and misinformation apart.
This is where foundations will come in handy.
Because foundations are universal they can be applied to a broad variety of topics and techniques and, as they say, to build a good house, you first put down a strong foundation.

## A lack of foundations in design education

We do not know if we have to blame today's design education or if there is less willingness today to invest time into learning the basics properly.
Both topics could be explored on their own.
But fact is that young design graduates are less and less able to execute simple tasks on their own and come up with promising results.
Instead a lot of them feel entitled to envision the grand scheme of things and have their vision realized.
To clarify: I like the approach of young designers having idealistic views and great ideas. 
But from my point of view, having ideas is actually the easy part of the job.
Having ideas does not cost money. Just a little time.
But actually manifesting an idea, enthralling other people and materializing an idea, bringing a thought to life, so to speak, is actually the hard part.
And I am not talking about the next big thing or solutions to climate change.
Instead I am talking about creating beautiful business cards, that you want to keep. Envelopes you reluctantly tear up and business stationery you want to caress.
Boring stuff. 
Important stuff.
Business stationery.
Collateral.
The boring blandness is even implied in the description.
Yet, it is still, even in the digital age one of the core pillars of any business and brand identity.
Because it is real.
Not real like a website.
It is even more real, because it is tangible.
This tangibility is what still lends business collateral a certain clout that rubs off on the business itself.
This is why companies, brands and designers still like to see a nice set of stationery, even if no physical business card is ever handed out.
But simply because it still is a part of the foundations.
But putting together this basic trinity of branding collateral of business card, invoice paper and envelope is increasingly hard for current design graduates.
Instead of sitting down and getting their hands "dirty" by exploring different executions they are heading to Youtube and Behance to look for a quick fix.
While there is nothing wrong with looking for ideas more often then not it is better to start working and trust that good ideas will come along the way. 
Shortcuts can be taken when you know how to drive offroad.
But first things first.
Because the truth is simply that it doesn't take "just 10 minutes" to get good results.
Being able to get to a good result in a short amount of time takes years of practice and applied knowledge.
The truth is, you are never finished learning.
For that our lifespan is simply to short.
But don't get discouraged.
You should instead view your design practice as a journey and have fun along the way.

## Do not just be someone elses robot

Maybe if you follow a certain pattern of steps you will get a good result in 10 minutes.
But remember that in these cases there is usually a very experienced person sitting at the other end that has already gone through these steps and is now telling you what to do.
This maybe fine for the solution at hand, but are you able to take those steps on your own and apply them to a different topic? 
Are you able to extrapolate the knowledge and make use of it in a broader context?
Well, if you had actually taken the time to learn the foundations, you could probably do that.
This is not to say that you should not look at other people's solutions.
Quite the opposite.
But to look at other people's solutions and to recognize and pull out the working parts to apply them to your own problems takes a gread deal of knowledge or experience.
Because if neither knowledge nor experience is available then you are merely copying the solution.

## Learning the basics

Only if you get the basics right you can apply the rules of design and when you are more advanced you can break them to get certain results.
"The rules of design" is quite a malleable term that has no clear definition.
If you ask ten people about those rules you will probably get twenty answers.
Or shrugging shoulders.
Luckily there are certain rules that, when following them, enable you to create visual designs that not only are pleasing but more importantly creating an impact in your target audience.
Knowing those rules gives you the confidence to create more freely and eventually more quickly.
Breaking those rules can lead to messy designs and projects that are not thought through.
But when you know the rules you can decide which rules to break and which only to bend a little.
At this point the work actually becomes interesting and you get even more confidence to take the design project in a new direction.
If you know which steps to take, where to take shortcuts and where it is important to continue to focus on quality, outstanding work can be achieved.
It should not be underestimated that learning the rules might sound boring at first but in the long run it will definitely help you to get good results consistently.

## Finding projects to bend the rules

Most clients are reluctand to go to far outside the box. Especially in the beginning of a relationship. 
To venture into unknown territory necessitates trust.
To create this trust you have to be able to show that you know the rules of the game.
Show, don't tell, that is important here!
It is difficult these days to find clients who are willing to spend money on you training or experimenting on their projects.
Not because clients are cash strapped.
But money these days has to be stretched more and more, simply because there is so much to cover these days. And everybody wants every Euro they spend to be maximised where possible.
But venturing a little into unknown territory?
That is possible on every project.
When you know the direction you have to go in.
If you know enough of the basics and could demonstrate enough to your client to build a positive rapport you can carve out small corners here and there where you can start to bend the rules a little.
Enough that you and your client are venturing into uncharted territory together.
The firmer your foundations the earlier and furhter you are allowed to venture off the beaten path.

## What are the basics?

Every design project needs a solid base to stand on.
Even though we live in the 2020ies and everything is becoming ever more digital you must not forget that the basics of design reach far back into history.
I do not want to bore you with academics now (that comes later) but always keep in mind that most things we do online or in the digital sphere is just an extension of analogue techniques of which the largest part has been handed down through the ages. 
And it is an advantage to know this history even if you look at the billions of websites that are online.
The vast majority of website uses the same Google Fonts.
But while certain patterns of webdesign have emerged over the years there are large differences in quality between "run-of-the-mill" websites and bespoke designed ones.
Not that one is necessarily better than the other, but one is probably more likely to engage visitors over a longer period of time and/or converts more easily or more regularly from visitors to customers.
What is most fascinating about this is that no matter which kind of style you prefer or if you asking someone that has never been on a website before, most people probably can discern into which website has been put more care.
Just by the way a layout is structured and the way colors and typography are used tells you a lot about the site, it's creators and the intended audience.
At this point these are all assumptions but they can be assumed safely if you are dealing with people from a similar cultural background as yourself.

So the basics that will comprise your design foundations are:
1. Shape or Form (Point, Line, Circle or Triangle)
2. Color (Black, White, Red, Green, Blue etc.)
3. Typography

While each of those can be a lifetime filling topic on it's own, they make up, in their simplest form the most basic and most common building blocks that every design project is comprised of.

## The foundation series

In the assumption that you have no knowledge of design we want to create this ongoing foundation series to help you get started.
While our target audience for these articles are junior designers coming fresh from university or still in their studies, everyone interested in the topic is welcome!
There is a vast amount of design training already available and we by now means want to or are even able to cover everything.
Instead we focus on what is important for young professionals working in the field from our point of view. Since our work experience has mainly bin in smaller teams in small to medium sized agencies we mied be a little more biased to this environment.
But we are open to share ideas and to create a discussion because ultimately our goal is to break down silos and share our knowledge to create a community and increase design literacy.
In doing so we consciously set a counterpoint for handmade design of good quality.
We do not care which tools you use.
It can be computer generated design an artificial intelligence.
It can be a handmade by yourself or painted by hand.
It does not matter.
As we already expressed: from our point of view certain basic rules apply,
We do not want to exclude certain ways of working.
They all have merit and every way of working can lead to great results.
But certain ways of working lend themselves better to creating great results consistently.
Such ways of working are called workflows and we will cover a few of them in the foundation series.
But feel free to add your personal flavour to them once you know the way.
Knowing those basics will enable you to stand up to the machines of the future that will inevitably come after your job.
Or to stand out from a crowd of samey designers.
Despite all the possibilities that young designers have nowadays, the YouTube tutorials, the dedicated design education sites, free university courses, heck, even high quality stock material, there at your fingertips, without leaving the house.
Despite all that the average level of quality of young job applicants is in decline.

Maybe it has to do with the fact that we live in a different time.
That today with the constant availability of internet everywhere, many people no longer have the desire, need or patience to sit down and work for hours on something.
It is understandable.
Even without Instagram, Twitter or TikTok you can succumb to the feeling that everything is already there.
Why make something new?
That is a thought you have to get rid of.
Instead of complaining that you are not up there with the millions of likes and followers you should rather think about whether you just "want" to be there or if you are actually ready to invest the time and work for it.
Luck may be a part of success.
No matter what: to be discovered a big piece has simply to do with consistently applied skill.
There may be the occasional one hit wonder.
But that's not what we subscribe to here at Phenotype.
