# Moodboards

- Foundations

*Moodboards are an important tool in design ideation.
Especially when starting new projects or working with new project partners or clients, Moodboards set the tone and direction for a project right from the outset and can give you the opportunity to explore different ideas in a short timeframe.*

Add to that "a picture is worth a thousand words" (as they say...) and talk your project stakeholders through your ideas guided by something they are actually able to see.
Moodboards are a tool that help to talk about something everybody can actually see which make them a powerful instrument in supporting ideas or start a conversation to guide the initial direction of the project.

A moodboard may present fancy suggestions, images or ideas.
That does not mean that simply by creating it the project will lead to a satisfactory end result or that the contents of the mood board can be transferred to the final product.
Instead, you have to take care of guiding the stakeholders along your moodboard to clarify the intentions of your selection and to inform about how the moodboard relates to the project.

All too often I have been part of projects that started with very good moodboards which where agreed upon with the client.
But as the project progressed these ideas became more and more watered down.
So much so in some cases that the end results did not have much in common with the initial ideas envisioned and agreed upon in the moodboards.

As a designer you have an important role in selecting and presenting moodboards to project stakeholders.
As such your responsibility is to make a selection that fits the project ideas and hits the sweet spot between getting everybody excited and being actually achievable.
While there is nothing wrong with blue sky thinking and only collecting awesome moods for a project special care must be taken, because for most projects it is advisable to present a selection of moods that could potentially be realised within the project constraints.
This guide will give you a few tips you can use when building your next moodboard.

## Where do moodboards come from?

Moodboards as we use them today originated in the areas of interior design and product design.
They where primarily physical boards showing a sample compilation of selected colours, fabrics, materials etc.
So that one can agree with the client on the design of a physical space or a physical product.
This was especially useful in a time where the visual fidelity of photographs was much lower.
Today however, mood boards can equally be purely digitally compiled collections of images, and in recent years Pinterest or similar online tools have become increasingly prominent for organising mood images.

## Selecting your Moods

The selection of suitable material for the moodboard is a delicate matter.
On the one hand, you want to show the client possibilities that have been implemented by industry or technology leaders.
On the other hand, you should also avoid showing too many images that show content where it is clear from the outset that the budget or the project framework is not even close to being sufficient to implement those ideas

Not every image is suitable for a mood board, because the term mood (image) is not chosen at random.
It is not about depicting a finished product, because then you would not have to create an independent design, but could simply copy an already existing design (which many companies are already doing successfully).
Instead, the aim is to show a selection of situations, colours, shapes, materials and styles that (assuming a little imagination) allow you to anticipate the final result to such an extent that you can decide on a common direction. However, it must still leave enough room for one's own ideas and design approaches.

A rule of thumb is that your moodboard should get the creative juices flowing without stifling them.
The ultimate goal is to only ever show moods that will never be as good as your final result.
If you manage to do that, your client will gladly do some word of mouth marketing for you.
